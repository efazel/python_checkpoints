# Python Checkpoints
Each notebook deals with a concept in programming in general, and python in particular. 

- In *class_instance*, different sets of commodities are defined in multiple classes.
- In *namedtuple*, difference between namedtuples and dictionaries is discussed.

The examples are based on the following table:
